                <p>Our motivation for this project was to better understand Portlanders transit preferences in relation
                    to different types of weather.
                    Specifically we wanted to look at how high levels of precipitation impacted TriMet transit system
                    ridership in relation to rideshare users.
                    Our hypothesis was that we would see a slight decline in TriMet bus ridership and a corresponding
                    increase in the number of rideshare users.
                    Unfortunately, the City of Portland does not require rideshare companies to publicly disclose any of
                    their internal data, so we were not able to
                    include rideshare user data as a part of our project.
                </p>
                <p>Instead, through a multiangle analysis of the Trimet transit system we explored if and how
                    precipitation impacts ridership within the MAX, WES, and Bus systems
                    on a month-to-month and year-to-year basis, as well as a brief exploration of the cost per boarding
                    passenger to identify strengths and weaknesses throughout
                    the TriMet transit system. Additionally, we created two transit system maps designed to enable users
                    to explore the geography of the TriMet transit system and
                    how ridership varies from neighborhood to neighborhood and city to city.

                <p>There are multiple views combining the total monthly precipitation data (across 6 cities in the
                    TriMet service area) with the estimated total monthly ridership on TriMet (taken from a weekly
                    average for each month):</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A scatter plot of with each marker representing each month’s ridership and precipitation total with
                    the ability to switch between each mode of transportation (Bus, MAX, Wes)
                </li>
            <li>A bar chart for each transit type, showing the selected month for each year in the three year
                    measurement period with ridership totals and a color scale indicating the total precipitation for
                    the same time period
                </li>
                <li>
                    A line chart that shows ridership throughout the selected year with each marker radius set indicate
                    the total precipitation in inches
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All charts are used to explore the relationship precipitation has with ridership. While there seems
                    to be no obvious patterns with regards to precipitations impact on TriMet’s ridership at a monthly
                    level, it is important to note that other variables (such as seasonality, weekday vs. weekend
                    ridership, year over year decline in overall usage, etc.) were not and in some cases could not be
                    factored into the included charts.
                </p>
                <p>The Cost vs Rides chart shows the cost per boarding passenger for buses in each of the four sample
                    periods between 2018 and 2019. The worst and best performers were identified, and maps were used to
                    find where these routes run.

                <h4 class="text-left index-subheader2">Conclusions:</h4>
                <p>Charts and maps show that the WES is the least used part of the system. The highest cost is Route 97
                    running between Sherwood and the Tualatin WES station. The conclusion is that buses feeding into the
                    WES will not be cost effective due to the low usage of the WES. The most cost effective is Route 14
                    running from downtown Portland to I205 and Foster. Its high density of bus stops in a fully
                    populated area make it the route that is closest to being profitable.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, it appears that bus ridership was less likely to be impacted by precipitation when compared
                    to the WES and MAX which show a slight decline in riders in months with heavy precipitation. There
                    is also a clear seasonality that presented itself when looking at the month over month ridership for
                    each year. The summer months (June through August) show a dip each of the three years as does the
                    month of December. This could be due to multiple factors (riders more likely to bike or walk in
                    nicer weather, students no longer taking transportation to school, workers and students taking
                    vacations, etc.). 2019 is the year with the heaviest overall precipitation and the lowest performing
                    year for TriMet, but this may be less to do with weather and more to do to the general decline of in
                    ridership that TriMet has experienced over the last several years.</p>
